The major purpose of C++ programming is to introduce the concept of object orientation to the C programming language.

Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.

The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as truly object-oriented programming language.

# **OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)**

Object means a real word entity such as pen, chair, table etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

##  1.Object:
Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.

## 2.Class
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

## 3.Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

## 4.Polymorphism
When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism.
C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.

## 5.Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

## 6.Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation.
